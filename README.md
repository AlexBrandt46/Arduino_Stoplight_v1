This is a basic Arduino project I created to experiment with using switches and buttons to control LEDs in a "stoplight" pattern. The diagram shown above was created using Fritzing. The red, yellow, and green LEDs are controlled using a button with the buttons' behavior being controlled by the switch connected with the blue LED.
